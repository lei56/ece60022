# ece60022

This is the repository for Jason Lei's ECE 60022 final project. The directory is structured in the following way:

include/
- Header files defining module-specific data structures and behavior. 

lib/
- Data structures used throughout design.

src/
- Source code for each module. The primary driver file is driver.c.

traces/
- Example tracefiles. Traces are organized in order of: flow ID, source user, flow size in packets, number of content IDs accessed by flow.

Use run.sh to compile and run code.
